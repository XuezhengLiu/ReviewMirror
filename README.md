# Introduction of Review Mirror
ReviewMirror is a website tool to help users to gain insightful information from reviews as well as to detect product on e-commerce sites which has fake reviews.

We create a review mirror website solution that will use a machine learning model to identify products with deceptive reviews, provide summary points of reviews, and provide other important insights from reviews.
